## Features
- Lane detection using computer vision techniques.
- Computation of lane curvature and off-center position.
- Driver assistance suggestions based on lane keeping.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- timeit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aalok786/Lane-Detection-Project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
   /cd lane-detection-project
4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
   -pip install-r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
  ...python main.py
2. Provide the video file path when prompted. You can also keep the input video in the same directory.

## Results
 After running the main.py, you will get an video file in the same local directory and on the screen showcasing the results.
 For the demo, I have attached a gif showing the output video.
